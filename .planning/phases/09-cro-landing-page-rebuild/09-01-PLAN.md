# Plan 09-01: Post-Demo Upsell Enhancement

<objective>
Enhance the post-demo experience to maximize conversions. This is the "money moment" - when users have just seen value and are most likely to purchase. Add value anchoring, better generating state, and stronger upsell copy.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.planning/phases/09-cro-landing-page-rebuild/SPEC.md (Section 2: Post-Demo Experience)
@src/routes/try/+page.svelte
@src/lib/components/LockedDocPreview.svelte
</execution_context>

<context>
**Current State:**
- Try page exists with basic loading state and upsell section
- LockedDocPreview component already has blurred overlay
- Missing: Value anchor copy, educational tips during generation, stronger CTA

**SPEC Requirements:**
- Generating state with rotating tips ("Did you know?" facts)
- Results showing free README prominently
- Blurred locked docs with $99 CTA
- Value anchor: "Technical writers charge $400-800. You pay $99. Once."

**Revenue Impact:** HIGH - This is where conversions happen
</context>

<tasks>

## Task 1: Enhanced Generating State

Update the loading state in `/try` page with educational tips and better UX.

**Requirements:**
- Progress bar with stages: "Reading file structure" → "Analyzing code patterns" → "Generating documentation"
- Rotating tip panel showing value props:
  - "Did you know? The average developer spends 6-8 hours writing docs."
  - "Codec8 analyzes your entire codebase in under 60 seconds."
  - "Professional technical writers charge $50-100/hour."
- Better visual feedback during generation

**File:** `src/routes/try/+page.svelte`

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Three-stage progress indicator
- [ ] Tips rotate every 4 seconds during generation
- [ ] Smooth transitions between stages

---

## Task 2: Value Anchor in Upsell Section

Add compelling value anchor copy after README is generated.

**Requirements:**
- Section header: "Unlock the complete documentation suite"
- Subhead: "$99 one-time (Technical writers: $400-800)"
- Checkbox list of what's included
- Clear pricing: "$99 one-time" not just "$99"
- CTA: "Get Complete Docs — $99"

**SPEC Copy:**
```
Technical writers charge $50-100/hr × 6-8 hours = $400-800.
You pay $99. Once.
```

**File:** `src/routes/try/+page.svelte`

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Value anchor copy visible after demo
- [ ] Price comparison prominently displayed
- [ ] Single primary CTA button

---

## Task 3: Update LockedDocPreview Component

Enhance the locked preview cards with stronger conversion messaging.

**Requirements:**
- Keep existing blurred overlay effect
- Update CTA from "Unlock with free trial" to context-aware:
  - On try page: "Included in $99 package"
  - Default: "Start free trial"
- Add hover state showing doc preview snippet
- Track analytics when clicked

**File:** `src/lib/components/LockedDocPreview.svelte`

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Props accept `ctaText` and `ctaHref` overrides
- [ ] Analytics tracked on click
- [ ] Accessible (proper aria labels)

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test the flow:
# 1. Go to http://localhost:5173/try?url=https://github.com/sveltejs/kit
# 2. Click Generate
# 3. Verify generating state shows tips

# 5. Verify locked doc cards have correct CTAs
```

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Generating state shows educational tips
- [ ] Value anchor visible: "$400-800" before "$99"
- [ ] Locked doc cards show "Included in $99"
- [ ] All content matches SPEC copy
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Accessible (screen reader tested)
</success_criteria>

<output>
Updated files:
- `src/routes/try/+page.svelte` - Enhanced post-demo experience
- `src/lib/components/LockedDocPreview.svelte` - Updated CTAs

Ready for: Plan 09-02 (Hero Section Redesign)
