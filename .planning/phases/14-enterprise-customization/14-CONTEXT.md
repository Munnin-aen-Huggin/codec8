# Phase 14: Enterprise Customization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** DEFERRED — User decided to focus on marketing/rollout first

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

White-label and customization options for enterprise customers. **DEFERRED** — enterprise requests will be handled via paywall + bespoke manual process until demand justifies building self-service features.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions (Partial — Discussion Interrupted)

### Custom Branding (Discussed)
- Logo + primary/accent colors only (not full white-label)
- Dashboard only — generated docs and public pages stay Codec8-branded
- Self-service settings page UI for team admins to upload logo and pick colors
- "Powered by Codec8" small footer badge when custom branding is active

### Custom Domain (Discussed)
- Subdomain only (acme.codec8.com), not full custom domains
- Serves a public doc portal (auth-required), not the full dashboard
- Available as a paid add-on, not included in Enterprise tier

### On-Premise / Hosting (Decided)
- No self-hosting. SaaS only.
- Data residency options were considered but deferred

### SLA & Support Tiers (Not Discussed)
- Deferred with the rest of enterprise customization

### Claude's Discretion
- N/A — phase deferred

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Enterprise customers should hit a paywall / "Contact Us" form
- Bespoke requests handled manually in writing (email/contract)
- Focus now shifts to marketing and product rollout

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Full white-label branding (remove all Codec8 mentions)
- Custom domain support (CNAME mapping)
- Data residency / region selection
- SLA tiers and uptime guarantees
- SOC 2 compliance documentation
- On-premise deployment

</deferred>
