# Launch Copy

## Twitter/X Launch Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I just launched Codec8 🚀

It generates professional documentation for your GitHub repos in minutes using Claude AI.

README, API docs, architecture diagrams, setup guides - all from your actual code.

Here's what it does and why I built it 🧵
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
Every developer knows this pain:

- Your README is outdated (or missing)
- You keep saying "I'll document it later"
- Contributors can't understand your code
- Your project looks abandoned

Good docs take hours. Who has time for that?
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
```
Codec8 reads your actual codebase:

→ Analyzes package.json, configs, folder structure
→ Understands your frameworks and dependencies
→ Generates docs that match YOUR project

Not generic templates. Real, context-aware documentation.
```

### Tweet 4 (Demo)
```
Here's how it works:

1. Connect your GitHub repo (read-only)
2. Select doc types (README, API, Architecture, Setup)
3. Click generate
4. Get professional docs in ~30 seconds

```

### Tweet 5 (Features)
```
What you get:

📝 README - Project overview, features, quick start
🔌 API Docs - Endpoints, parameters, examples
🏗️ Architecture - System design with Mermaid diagrams
⚙️ Setup Guide - Installation, configuration, deployment

All editable. Export as markdown or create a PR.
```

### Tweet 6 (Pricing)
```
Pricing:

🆓 Free: 1 repository
💰 Lifetime Deal: $99 (unlimited repos, forever)
🚀 Pro Setup: $497 (LTD + 30-min call)

The LTD won't last forever. No subscriptions, no recurring fees.

## Hacker News - Show HN Post

**Title:**
```
Show HN: Codec8 – Generate professional documentation from GitHub repos with Claude AI
```

**Body:**
```
Hey HN,

I built Codec8 to solve a problem I've had for years: documentation debt.

We all know documentation is important, but it always ends up at the bottom of the to-do list. After yet another weekend spent writing READMEs, I decided to automate it.

**What it does:**
- Connect any GitHub repository (read-only OAuth)
- AI analyzes your codebase structure, dependencies, and key files
- Generates 4 types of docs: README, API documentation, architecture diagrams (Mermaid), and setup guides
- Edit inline, export markdown, or create a PR directly

**Tech stack:**
- SvelteKit + TypeScript
- Supabase (auth + database)
- Claude API for generation
- Stripe for payments
- Deployed on Vercel

**What I learned:**
- Context is everything. Generic prompts produce generic docs. I spent most of my time on the parsing logic to give Claude relevant context.
- Mermaid diagrams are surprisingly hard to generate correctly. Lots of iteration on the prompts.
- Markdown preview in a web editor is trickier than it looks (ended up using marked + DOMPurify).

**Pricing:**
Free for 1 repo, $99 lifetime deal for unlimited. No subscriptions - I hate those too.

Would love feedback, especially on:
1. What documentation formats would you add?
2. Any repos I can test it on? I'll share the output.

## Reddit Post - r/SideProject

**Title:**
```
I built an AI tool that generates documentation for GitHub repos - Codec8
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject!

After years of putting off documentation, I finally built something to automate it.

**What is it?**
Codec8 connects to your GitHub repos and generates professional documentation using Claude AI. Not generic templates - it actually reads your code and creates docs specific to your project.

**What it generates:**
- README with project overview, features, quick start
- API documentation for your endpoints
- Architecture diagrams using Mermaid
- Setup/installation guides

**How it works:**
1. Sign in with GitHub (read-only access)
2. Connect a repository
3. Select what docs you need
4. Get results in ~30 seconds
5. Edit, export, or create a PR

**The boring business stuff:**
- Free tier: 1 repo
- Lifetime deal: $99 (no subscriptions!)
- Built with SvelteKit, Supabase, Claude API

**Why I built it:**
I maintain a few open source projects and the documentation was always the last thing I updated. Spent a weekend writing docs and thought "there has to be a better way."

Would love to hear what you think! Happy to answer any questions or generate docs for your projects.

## LinkedIn Post

```
I just launched Codec8 🚀

It's an AI tool that generates professional documentation for GitHub repositories.

The problem it solves:
Documentation is essential, but most of us put it off. A good README can be the difference between users adopting your project or bouncing after 5 seconds.

What it does:
→ Connect your GitHub repo
→ AI analyzes your codebase
→ Get README, API docs, architecture diagrams, setup guides
→ Edit and export or create a PR

Built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Claude AI.

Try it free: codec8.com
