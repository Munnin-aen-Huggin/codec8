Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Codec8 because I was tired of documentation debt. Every project I worked on had outdated (or missing) docs, and I kept saying "I'll write them later."

So I automated it. Connect your GitHub repo, and Codec8 reads your actual codebase — package.json, folder structure, route files, config — and generates 4 types of docs:

📝 README with project overview and quick start
🔌 API documentation with endpoints and examples
🏗️ Architecture diagrams using Mermaid
⚙️ Setup guide with installation and deployment steps

It's not generic templates. The output is specific to YOUR project.

I'm launching with a $99 lifetime deal — unlimited repos, forever. No subscriptions.

Want to test it? Drop a link to your repo in the comments and I'll generate docs for it live! 🙌

Hey HN,

I built Codec8 to solve a problem I've had for years: documentation debt. We all know docs are important, but they always end up at the bottom of the to-do list.

What it does:
- Connect any GitHub repository (read-only OAuth)
- AI analyzes your codebase structure, dependencies, and key files
- Generates 4 types of docs: README, API reference, architecture diagrams (Mermaid), and setup guides
- Edit inline, export markdown, or create a PR directly

Tech stack: SvelteKit + TypeScript, Supabase (auth + database), Claude API for generation, Stripe for payments, deployed on Vercel.

What I learned building this:
- Context is everything. Generic prompts produce generic docs. Most development time went into the parsing logic — extracting relevant code patterns, config files, route structures — to give Claude enough context to produce useful output.
- Mermaid diagram generation is hard. Getting syntactically valid and semantically meaningful diagrams required extensive prompt iteration.
- The 80/20 rule applies: a generated README that's 80% right and needs 5 minutes of editing beats spending an hour writing one from scratch.

Pricing: Free for 1 repo. $99 lifetime deal for unlimited. No subscriptions.

Would love feedback, especially on:
1. What documentation formats would you add?
2. Any repos I can test it on? Happy to share the output.

**Title:**
```
I built an AI tool that generates documentation for GitHub repos — Codec8
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject!

After years of putting off documentation, I finally built something to automate it.

**What is it?**
Codec8 connects to your GitHub repos and generates professional documentation using Claude AI. Not generic templates — it reads your actual code and creates docs specific to your project.

**What it generates:**
- README with project overview, features, quick start
- API documentation for your endpoints
- Architecture diagrams using Mermaid
- Setup/installation guides

**How it works:**
1. Sign in with GitHub (read-only access)
2. Connect a repository
3. Select what docs you need
4. Get results in ~30 seconds
5. Edit, export, or create a PR

**The boring business stuff:**
- Free tier: 1 repo
- Lifetime deal: $99 (no subscriptions!)
- Built with SvelteKit, Supabase, Claude API

**Why I built it:**
I maintain a few projects and the documentation was always the last thing I updated. Spent a weekend writing docs and thought "there has to be a better way."

Would love to hear what you think! Happy to answer any questions or generate docs for your projects.

### r/webdev

**Submit at:** https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/submit

**Title:**
```
I built a tool that generates README, API docs, and architecture diagrams from your GitHub repo
```

**Body:**
```
Documentation is one of those things everyone agrees is important but nobody wants to do. I've been building web apps for years and my docs are always the weakest part of every project.

So I built Codec8 — it connects to your GitHub repo (read-only), analyzes the codebase, and generates 4 types of documentation:

1. **README** — Project overview, features, quick start with install commands
2. **API Reference** — Endpoints, parameters, response examples
3. **Architecture Overview** — System diagrams using Mermaid, data flow, design decisions
4. **Setup Guide** — Installation, environment setup, deployment

It's powered by Claude AI and actually reads your code — not just file names. So the output is specific to your project's frameworks, dependencies, and structure.

**Stack:** SvelteKit, TypeScript, Supabase, Claude API, Stripe, Vercel

**Pricing:** Free for 1 repo, $99 lifetime for unlimited (no subscription).

Happy to generate docs for anyone's repo if you want to see the output quality before signing up.

I just launched Codec8 🚀

It generates professional documentation for your GitHub repos in minutes using Claude AI.

README, API docs, architecture diagrams, setup guides — all from your actual code.

Here's what it does and why I built it 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Every developer knows this pain:

- Your README is outdated (or missing)
- You keep saying "I'll document it later"
- Contributors can't understand your code
- Your project looks abandoned

Good docs take hours. Who has time for that?
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Codec8 reads your actual codebase:

→ Analyzes package.json, configs, folder structure
→ Understands your frameworks and dependencies
→ Generates docs that match YOUR project

Not generic templates. Real, context-aware documentation.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Here's how it works:

1. Connect your GitHub repo (read-only)
2. Select doc types (README, API, Architecture, Setup)
3. Click generate
4. Get professional docs in ~30 seconds
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
What you get:

📝 README — Project overview, features, quick start
🔌 API Docs — Endpoints, parameters, examples
🏗️ Architecture — System design with Mermaid diagrams
⚙️ Setup Guide — Installation, configuration, deployment

All editable. Export as markdown or create a PR.
```

I just launched Codec8 🚀

It's an AI tool that generates professional documentation for GitHub repositories.

The problem it solves:
Documentation is essential, but most of us put it off. A good README can be the difference between users adopting your project or bouncing after 5 seconds.

What it does:
→ Connect your GitHub repo
→ AI analyzes your codebase
→ Get README, API docs, architecture diagrams, setup guides
→ Edit and export or create a PR

Built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Claude AI.

Try it free: codec8.com

What project would you document first?
