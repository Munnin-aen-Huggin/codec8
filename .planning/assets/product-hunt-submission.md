## Maker Comment (First Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], the maker of Codec8.

Like most developers, I have a love-hate relationship with documentation. I know it's important, but it always ends up at the bottom of my to-do list.

So I built Codec8 to solve this for myself - and hopefully for you too.

Here's what makes it different:
- It actually reads your code, not just your file names
- The output is genuinely useful, not generic boilerplate
- You can edit everything before committing
- Lifetime deal means you're not locked into a subscription

I'm launching with a special $99 LTD that won't last forever.

Would love to hear your feedback! What documentation pain points do you have? What features would make this even more useful?

Ask me anything in the comments! 🙌

## First Comment Strategy

**Immediately after launch:**
1. Post maker comment (above)
2. Reply to early comments within 5 minutes
3. Share behind-the-scenes of how it was built

**Engagement plan:**
- Answer every question personally
- Ask follow-up questions to start conversations
- Thank people for feedback, even critical
- Share specific examples of generated docs
- Offer to generate docs for commenters' repos

**Prepared responses:**

*For "How does it handle [language]?"*
> Great question! Codec8 works with any language - it analyzes your project structure, package files, and key source files. [Language] projects work great because we detect [specific pattern]. Want me to try it on one of your repos?

*For "How is this different from Copilot/ChatGPT?"*
> Great question! While you could paste code into ChatGPT, Codec8 is purpose-built for documentation: it automatically fetches your repo structure, identifies key files, and generates properly formatted markdown. Plus it creates PRs directly to your repo. It's the difference between a Swiss Army knife and a specialized tool.

*For "Is my code safe?"*
> Security is a top priority. We only request read-only access to your repos, and we never store your source code. We only keep the generated documentation. You can revoke access anytime from GitHub settings.
